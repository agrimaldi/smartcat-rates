As a child, you just simply take everything in and while learning a new language, you are also learning a new culture and way of thinking.\n\nAt age 13 I moved back to Spain. I was then able to cement my Spanish cultural roots. Then, when I was 15-years-old, we moved again, this time to Portugal. Here I was able to learn Portuguese at still an early age.\n\nAfter obtaining two University Degrees, in Law and Business Administration, and an MBA in International Business Management, I worked for several years as a lawyer, external auditor in PwC, financial controller and cost manager in several countries around the world. Throughout this time, I also worked as a freelance translator and reviser for a Law Firm for over 8 years.\n\nIt then became clear to me that I was meant to be a translator and now I work as a full-time translator and reviser.","offsetFromUtc":60,"completedProjectCount":2,"translatedWordCount":303381,"accountCompletedProjectCount":0,"accountTranslatedWordCount":0,"aggregatedScores":{"aggregatedQualityScore":0,"aggregatedTimeManagementScore":0,"scoreCount":0},"lastSeen":"2019-05-21T11:15:52.419Z","sortingCoefficients":null,"isFuzzyMatchByName":false,"allServices":[],"matchedService":{"generalizedSourceLanguageId":9,"generalizedTargetLanguageId":10,"sourceLanguageDialects":[],"targetLanguageDialects":[],"specializations":[],"relevantBadges":[],"pricePerUnit":0.07,"currency":1,"serviceType":1,"isPaidExternally":false},"hasWrittenServices":true},{"userId":"1739f963-c9b4-47f8-9c55-7b44a2fb8c4c","alias":"maria-pacheco-1","accountId":null,"myTeamProfileType":null,"roleName":null,"isPrivate":false,"myTeamProfileEmail":null,"myTeamProfileExternalId":null,"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Pacheco","transliteratedFullName":"Maria Pacheco","country":"ARG","city":"Mendoza","profileImageUrl":"https://accounts.smartcat.ai/users/1739f963-c9b4-47f8-9c55-7b44a2fb8c4c/profileImage?imageId=5cc89be5b987bb26acfcafe8","about":"I am an English-Spanish translator and I am looking to gain experience in this beautiful environment.","offsetFromUtc":-180,"completedProjectCount":2,"translatedWordCount":38283,"accountCompletedProjectCount":0,"accountTranslatedWordCount":0,"aggregatedScores":{"aggregatedQualityScore":100,"aggregatedTimeManagementScore":100,"scoreCount":1},"lastSeen":"2019-05-21T15:53:08.949Z","sortingCoefficients":null,"isFuzzyMatchByName":false,"allServices":[],"matchedService":{"generalizedSourceLanguageId":9,"generalizedTargetLanguageId":10,"sourceLanguageDialects":[1033,2057],"targetLanguageDialects":[11274],"specializations":[1002,1044,1052,1018,1049,1046],"relevantBadges":[],"pricePerUnit":0.1,"currency":1,"serviceType":1,"isPaidExternally":false},"hasWrittenServices":true},{"userId":"edf5bc21-fe67-464d-9ea6-8d3aef69c571","alias":"karla-de-seijas","accountId":null,"myTeamProfileType":null,"roleName":null,"isPrivate":false,"myTeamProfileEmail":null,"myTeamProfileExternalId":null,"firstName":"Karla","lastName":"de Seijas","transliteratedFullName":"Karla de Seijas","country":"GTM","city":"Guatemala","profileImageUrl":"https://accounts.smartcat.ai/users/edf5bc21-fe67-464d-9ea6-8d3aef69c571/profileImage?imageId=5bceb79360fc561fb0ae11dc","about":"I've been translating since 1998 about several subjects.

My name is Fernando and I currently am halfway through my Bachelor's Degree in International Business and I just began a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design, so as you could imagine, studying both at the same time is very time consuming, that's why I had to look for a way to earn some money to pay my bills that wasn't so time consuming, and I happen to be very good at English, so I am now offering my translating skills to fullfill my wish of studying my second career, Graphic Design.\n\nI began studying English since I was in kindergarten, later adopting a focus in British English too when I entered Junior High because of a shift in my school's teaching program. On top of that, my parents also dominate the language so they made sure all the media I consumed was in English, so in all my life I've never stopped practicing it. This was reinforced when I began High School, as I was chosen to enter an all-bilingual program, in which every subject I had was teached in this language.","offsetFromUtc":-360,"completedProjectCount":0,"translatedWordCount":9,"accountCompletedProjectCount":0,"accountTranslatedWordCount":0,"aggregatedScores":{"aggregatedQualityScore":0,"aggregatedTimeManagementScore":0,"scoreCount":0},"lastSeen":null,"sortingCoefficients":null,"isFuzzyMatchByName":false,"allServices":[],"matchedService":{"generalizedSourceLanguageId":9,"generalizedTargetLanguageId":10,"sourceLanguageDialects":[1033,2057],"targetLanguageDialects":[2058,1034],"specializations":[1011,13,1002,1012,1054,9,14,3,1010,1,1044,1017,10,1052,1018,1027,1032,1023,4,1041,1025,1048,1026],"relevantBadges":[],"pricePerUnit":0.009,"currency":1,"serviceType":1,"isPaidExternally":false},"hasWrittenServices":true},{"userId":"fc36a537-3ba2-4e09-9698-210a51456ca2","alias":"traduservice-1","accountId":null,"myTeamProfileType":null,"roleName":null,"isPrivate":false,"myTeamProfileEmail":null,"myTeamProfileExternalId":null,"firstName":"Traduservice","lastName":"1","transliteratedFullName":"Traduservice 1","country":null,"city":null,"profileImageUrl":null,"about":null,"offsetFromUtc":-360,"completedProjectCount":0,"translatedWordCount":0,"accountCompletedProjectCount":0,"accountTranslatedWordCount":0,"aggregatedScores":{"aggregatedQualityScore":0,"aggregatedTimeManagementScore":0,"scoreCount":0},"lastSeen":null,"sortingCoefficients":null,"isFuzzyMatchByName":false,"allServices":[],"matchedService":{"generalizedSourceLanguageId":9,"generalizedTargetLanguageId":10,"sourceLanguageDialects":[],"targetLanguageDialects":[],"specializations":[],"relevantBadges":[],"pricePerUnit":0.05,"currency":1,"serviceType":1,"isPaidExternally":false},"hasWrittenServices":true},{"userId":"e3348f56-ebe2-4a99-8d2b-5d0f78cc65e0","alias":"facundo-zocola","accountId":null,"myTeamProfileType":null,"roleName":null,"isPrivate":false,"myTeamProfileEmail":null,"myTeamProfileExternalId":null,"firstName":"Facundo","lastName":"Zocola","transliteratedFullName":"Facundo Zocola","country":"ARG","city":"Tigre","profileImageUrl":"https://accounts.smartcat.ai/users/e3348f56-ebe2-4a99-8d2b-5d0f78cc65e0/profileImage?imageId=5ced3cb86a9e860820aa4a94","about":"Hi there! My name is Facundo and I'm from Argentina.\n\nSPANISH is my native language.\n\nAlso, I have been studying, reading, working, speaking and listening to the ENGLISH language for the past twenty years on a DAILY BASIS. This is real. I'm in touch with English every single day. I probably know more English than I think I do.\n\nAlso, I speak and write some PORTUGUESE, so I'm also up for easy translations/writing jobs in that language as well.\n\nI am not a professional translator. I haven't studied any careers and/or courses, so that's why I'm not up for any technical translation jobs, like medical, legal, etc.\n\nHowever, I'm really good at translating customs blog posts, articles, video games, stories, general conversation, movie scripts, subtitles, etc. \n\nI also know a lot about\n+ Tourism\n+ Sports\n+ Video Games\n+ TV and Streaming Services\n+ Pop Culture\n+ Science-Fiction\n+ eSports\n+
